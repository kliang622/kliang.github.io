# kliang.github.io

Over Quarantine I decided to further my computing knowledge with the time I had and embark on HTML and CSS with the help of the internet. 
Putting my knowledge to the test, I challenged myself to create a personal website for myself to create an online presence for myself so that people could know me better than my paper resume. 
With obstacles along the way (school, other time commitments) this project is taking longer than expected. 
However, through this process, I am learning so much and enjoying every step of this process of creation!
