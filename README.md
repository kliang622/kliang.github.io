# kliang.github.io

Over Qurentine I decided to furthure my computing knowledge and embark HTML and CSS with the help of the internet. 
Putting my knowledge to the test, I challegened myself to create a personal website for myself to create an online precense for myself so that poeple could know me better than the paper resume. 
With obstacles along the way (school, other time commitments) this project is taking longer than expected. 
However, through this process, I am definately learning much more!
